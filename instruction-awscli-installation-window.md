This is the instruction to install/setup aws on Windows

Use `pip` to install aws-cli
```
pip install aws-shell
```

Create access ID & key from `Account (top-right) > Security credentials > My security credentials > Access keys`. Then create a new key for aws-cli purpose.
Note: key will not be stored on the console, must copy it down and store somewhere locally.
